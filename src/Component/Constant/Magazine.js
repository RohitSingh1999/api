          `December is our favorite time of the year. It is the month when we leave away all the baggage and sorrows of the present year and make goals and look forward to the New Year. It is also the month when our beloved Mr. Santa Claus comes in with tons of gifts. Of course, how can we forget about the magnificent sales! This year we will be your Santa and gift you with tons of fashion tips, makeup tips, and most importantly nutriment tips. After all, we don’t want you out of shape by the time you get ready to enter 2023. Sit back and relax because we will always be there to care for your beauty and health. With this edition, we end the year 2022. We hope to see all of you back next year as well for all the amazing ideas and tips we are yet to share with you. Wish you all a happy, healthy, and wealthy New Year ahead. Best wishes, Team World Model Hunt.`,
